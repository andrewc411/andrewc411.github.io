        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Greetings friend, my name is Andrew Carroll. I am a Web Developer
          located in the beautiful city of Atlanta, Georgia. I began my coding
          journey not long after the start of the pandemic in the Spring of
          2021. I began with teaching myself Python, while utilizing many online
          resources. Towards the start of the Summer in 2021, I had built my
          first web application. A choose your story game using Python
          conditionals. By the end of that Summer, I knew coding was not just an
          option for career path, but an enjoyable and rewarding hobby.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always considered myself an artist. Code has allowed me a new
          medium for self expression. To open an empty file and fill it with the
          whatever elements I want to portray in a website or web application
          gave me emmense joy. Pure creation in a form that allows infinite
          creative possibilities. I felt unique as someone naturally right-brain
          dominant (artistic, creative, and spontaneous) in a field that many
          consider left-brain dominated (logical, rational, and calculating).
        </p>
        <p>
          I brought this mentality of uniqueness when attending the Full-Stack
          Web Development Bootcamp at Georgia Tech in the Fall of 2021, choosing
          to view my artistic side as an asset. Moving through the classes and
          homeworks I learned many different skills while focusing on the MERN
          stack. Using technologies that ranged from frontend (HTML5, CSS,
          JavaScript) to the backend (MySQL and MongoDB) and plenty versatile
          technologies in between (Node.js and React). I have worked with
          Insomnia REST for debugging and testing APIs and GraphQL for API data
          query and manipulation. As an artist, I had fun learning about
          Bootstrap, an open-source frontend framework focused around styled
          elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          I faced many challenges in this bootcamp and with focus and
          persistence, as well as a terrific support system, was eligible to
          graduate in February of 2022. Having been officially Georgia Tech
          certified as a Web Developer, I was ready to further my education even
          more and hopefully land my first tech job in the process. In the June
          2022 I made my entrance into the tech industry as a Web Developer for
          Kinetech Solutions, LLC a startup tech company right here in Atlanta,
          Georgia. Since my employment I have worked with Docker to develop a
          Gravity app. Which is a SaaS Boilerplate application that uses
          Node.js. While also refining and sharpening my skills acquired during
          my time at Georgia Tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking my journey one day at a time, I have started the path. And once
          you start, there is no going back. It has been a tough climb, and I
          know the view is beautiful from the top of the mountain.
