            This was the first coding project that I ever made. A web
            application written in Python. It's a creative and fun game, however
            might not be suited for all ages (+18). Using strictly conditionals,
            forge your own path and see if you can make it to the end. Safe
            travels!

        <h3>About Me [Bio]ü§ñ</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Greetings friend, my name is Andrew Carroll. I am a Web Developer
          located in the beautiful city of Atlanta, Georgia. I began my coding
          journey not long after the start of the pandemic in the Spring of
          2021. I began with teaching myself Python, while utilizing many online
          resources. Towards the start of the Summer in 2021, I had built my
          first web application. A choose your story game using Python
          conditionals. By the end of that Summer, I knew coding was not just an
          option for career path, but an enjoyable and rewarding hobby.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always considered myself an artist. Code has allowed me a new
          medium for self expression. To open an empty file and fill it with
          whatever elements I want to portray in a website or web application
          gave me emmense joy. Pure creation in a form that allows infinite
          creative possibilities. I felt unique as someone naturally right-brain
          dominant (artistic, creative, and spontaneous) in a field that many
          consider left-brain dominated (logical, rational, and calculating).
        </p>
        <p>
          I brought this mentality of uniqueness when attending the Full-Stack
          Web Development Bootcamp at Georgia Tech in the Fall of 2021, choosing
          to view my artistic side as an asset. While moving through the classes
          and homeworks, I learned many different skills focusing on the MERN
          stack. Using technologies that ranged from frontend (HTML5, CSS,
          JavaScript) to the backend (MySQL and MongoDB) and plenty versatile
          technologies in between (Node.js and React). I have worked with
          Insomnia REST for debugging and testing APIs and GraphQL for API data
          query and manipulation. As an artist, I had fun learning about
          Bootstrap, an open-source frontend framework focused around styled
          elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          I faced many challenges in this bootcamp and with focus and
          persistence, as well as a terrific support system, was eligible to
          graduate in February of 2022. Having been officially Georgia Tech
          certified as a Web Developer, I was ready to further my education even
          more and land my first tech job in the process. In June of 2022 I made
          my entrance into the tech industry as a Web Developer for
          <a class="job" target="_blank" href="https://kinetech.llc/"
            >Kinetech Solutions, LLC</a
          >
          a startup tech company right here in Atlanta, Georgia. Since my
          employment I have worked with Docker to develop a Gravity app. Which
          is a SaaS Boilerplate application that uses Node.js. While also
          refining and sharpening the many skills that I acquired during my time
          at Georgia Tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking my journey one day at a time, I have started the path. And once
          you start, there is no going back. It has been a tough climb, and I
          know the view is beautiful from the top of the mountain.
