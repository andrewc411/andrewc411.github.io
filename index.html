                    The first coding project that I have ever made. A web application
                    written in Python, using replit's IDE. It's a creative and fun game, however

          <h3>About Me [Bio]ü§ñ</h3>
          <hr/>
          <p>
            Greetings friend, my name is Andrew Carroll. I am a Web Developer
            located in the beautiful city of Atlanta, Georgia. I began my coding
            journey not long after the start of the pandemic in the Spring of
            2021. I began with teaching myself Python, while utilizing many
            online resources. Towards the start of the Summer in 2021, I had
            built my first web application. A choose your story game using
            Python conditionals. By the end of that Summer, I knew coding was
            not just an option for career path, but an enjoyable and rewarding
            hobby.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have always considered myself an artist. Code has allowed me a new
            medium for self expression. To open an empty file and fill it with
            whatever elements I want to portray in a website or web application
            gave me emmense joy. Pure creation in a form that allows nearly
            infinite creative possibilities. I felt unique as someone naturally
            right-brain dominant (artistic, creative, and spontaneous) in a
            field that many consider left-brain dominated (logical, rational,
            and calculating).
          </p>
          <p>
            I brought this mentality of uniqueness when attending the Full-Stack
            Web Development Bootcamp at Georgia Tech in the Fall of 2021,
            choosing to view my artistic side as an asset. While moving through
            the classes and homeworks, I learned many different skills focusing
            on the MERN stack. Using technologies that ranged from frontend
            (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript) to the backend (MySQL and MongoDB) and
            plenty versatile technologies in between (Node.js and React). I have
            worked with Insomnia REST for debugging and testing APIs and GraphQL
            for API data query and manipulation. As an artist, I had fun
            learning about Bootstrap, an open-source frontend framework focused
            around styled elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            I faced many challenges in this bootcamp and with focus and
            persistence, as well as a terrific support system, was eligible to
            graduate in February of 2022. Having been officially Georgia Tech
            certified as a Web Developer, I was ready to further my education
            even more and land my first tech job in the process. In June of 2022
            I made my entrance into the tech industry as a Web Developer for
            <a class="job" target="_blank" href="https://kinetech.llc/"
              >Kinetech Solutions, LLC</a
            >
            a startup tech company right here in Atlanta, Georgia. Since my
            employment I have worked with Docker to develop a Gravity app. Which
            is a SaaS Boilerplate application that uses Node.js. While also
            refining and sharpening the many skills that I acquired during my
            time at Georgia Tech.
          </p>
          <p>
            Taking my journey one day at a time, I have started the path. And
            once you start, there is no going back. It has been a tough climb,
            and I know the view is beautiful from the top of the mountain.
